***

## Confusing chat: `words`

This setting is located at the very end of the config, it allows you to change chat messages from drunk players.

An example of the setup looks like this:

```yaml
words:
- replace: e # Replace all letters "e"
to: EEE # with "EEE"
percentage: 90 # Chance that the letter "e" will be replaced
alcohol: 30 # What alcohol level will this setting work on?

- replace: y # Replace all letters "y"
   to: YY # On "YY"
   pre: y # If there was a letter "y" before it
   match: false # Should the letter "y" be before "y" for this setting to work
   alcohol: 10 # What alcohol level will this setting work on?
   percentage: 70 # Chance that the letter "y" will be replaced
```
